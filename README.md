# Novabot-Discord

This project served as a way to improve my Python language skills and learn about synchronous vs asynchronous programming.

# How it works

Using discord API and a software called FFmpeg, I was able to make a music bot using asyncio with Python. Using a command such as !play, followed by either a youtube url or song title, you are able to make a request to youtube and retrieve the video data which FFmpeg converts to data accepted by the discord API. You are also able to manage your servers such as kicking users through use of other commands.
